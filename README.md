# Week One Homework 4/9
-This week's assignment was to refactor the html and css files of an existing site. 

-The purposes of refactoring are using semantic elements to aid others in viewing your code, ensure accessbility for users who have screen readers, and simplify in order to have concise coding.

-Before refactoring the html, it did not use semantic elements,  the references to image sources were missing alt attributes, and the heading tags were not in sequestional order. My first step was to change the numberous "divs" to the most applicable semantic element for the portion of the code, including header, section, footer. I then added alt attributes to each image that did not have one, so that in the event the image is not able to be displayed a brief description of the photo is displayed. Finally, I reviewed and revised each of the heading elements to ensure they followed a numerical flow.

-Before refactoring the CSS, each element had its own styling, though several of them used the same styling as its siblings in the same sections of the page. In order to condense the CSS and make it more concise, I grouped the elements that had the same styling.

-Below is a link to my page, as well as a screenshot.
